## ⚠️ WINDOWS DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES (Legacy - Now Solved!)

### 🎯 What's Working

✅ **Dev server runs** - Successfully starts on port 3001
✅ **Pages load** - Login page renders correctly
✅ **Database connected** - PostgreSQL running (fixed!)
✅ **APIs respond** - Analytics, monitoring, session endpoints work
✅ **UI renders** - All components display properly

### ❌ What's Broken

❌ **Login fails** - NextAuth routing bug (`UnknownAction: Cannot parse action at /api/auth/login`)
❌ **Server crashes** - Watchpack regex error every 20-30 seconds (Windows issue)
❌ **Production build fails** - Windows path handling issues (unfixable on Windows)
❌ **Can't test features** - Login required for all dashboard pages

---

## 📊 REALISTIC ASSESSMENT
