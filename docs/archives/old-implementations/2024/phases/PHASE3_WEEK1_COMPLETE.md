## 🔬 Technical Innovations

### 1. ServiceResponse Pattern

```typescript
// Discriminated union ensures type safety
type ServiceResponse<T> = ServiceSuccessResponse<T> | ServiceErrorResponse;

// TypeScript knows exactly which properties exist
if (response.success) {
  console.log(response.data); // ✅ TypeScript knows this exists
} else {
  console.log(response.error); // ✅ TypeScript knows this exists
}
```

### 2. Repository Pattern Integration

```typescript
// Clean separation: Service → Repository → Database
class FarmService extends BaseService {
  constructor(private repository = farmRepository) {
    super({
      /* config */
    });
  }

  async createFarm(data) {
    // Business logic in service
    const validated = await this.validateFarm(data);

    // Data access in repository
    const farm = await this.repository.manifestFarm(validated);

    return createSuccessResponse(farm);
  }
}
```

### 3. OpenTelemetry Tracing

```typescript
// Automatic distributed tracing
return await traceServiceOperation(
  "FarmService",
  "createFarm",
  { "farm.name": data.name },
  async (span) => {
    addSpanEvent("validation_completed");
    addSpanEvent("farm_created", { farmId: farm.id });
    setSpanAttributes({ "farm.slug": slug });
    // Operation logic
  },
);
```

### 4. Agricultural Consciousness

```typescript
// Domain-specific awareness
return createSuccessResponse(farm, {
  agricultural: {
    season: this.getCurrentSeason(), // "WINTER"
    consciousness: "DIVINE",
    entityType: "farm",
  },
});
```
