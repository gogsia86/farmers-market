Date: December 19, 2025
Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ISSUES FIXED
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Issue #1: Husky Git Hooks Failure
   Error: sh: husky: not found (exit code 127)
   Root Cause: Git hooks running in Docker build context
   Solution:
   - Updated package.json prepare script to skip in CI/Docker
   - Added HUSKY=0 and CI=true to Dockerfile
   - Used --ignore-scripts flag in npm ci
   Impact: Docker build now completes successfully

✅ Issue #2: Missing Environment Variables
   Error: 9 warnings about unset optional variables
   Services: Email, Sentry, Google Maps, Cloudinary, etc.
   Solution:
   - Added default empty values (:-) for all optional vars
   - Added comments explaining fallback behavior
   Impact: Clean startup without warnings

✅ Issue #3: Deprecated Docker Compose Version
   Error: "version" attribute is obsolete
   Solution:
   - Removed deprecated version: "3.9" line
   Impact: Clean docker-compose output
