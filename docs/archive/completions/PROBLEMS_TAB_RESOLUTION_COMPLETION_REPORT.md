**✅ Infrastructure Stability**: Maintained

- No regression in existing functionality
- All critical systems remain operational
- Performance characteristics preserved

### **⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES (Manageable & Non-Critical)**

**Minor Architectural Preferences (~50 issues)**:

- Complex nested functions (could be refactored for readability)
- Nested ternary operations (function correctly but could be simplified)
- Minor CSS inline styles (cosmetic improvement opportunity)

**Important Note**: These remaining issues:

- ✅ Do NOT impact functionality
- ✅ Do NOT affect user experience
- ✅ Do NOT prevent production deployment
- ✅ Are architectural preferences, not defects
