The attached file contains a TypeScript script for a Comprehensive Website Inspector Bot v2.0.0, designed to test a Farmers Market Platform across ~100 pages in public, customer, farmer, admin, auth, legal, and API categories using Playwright. Godlike upgrades transform it into a production-grade, scalable tool with CI/CD integration, advanced metrics, parallel execution, and self-healing capabilities.[1]

## Core Upgrades
- Parallelize page inspections using multiple browser contexts (e.g., `Promise.allSettled` for up to 5 concurrent pages) to cut runtime from hours to minutes on 100+ pages.[1]
- Integrate Lighthouse for full performance audits (LCP, CLS, TBT) and axe-core for comprehensive a11y scanning, replacing basic checks.[1]
- Add Puppeteer-cluster or Playwright worker pools for distributed testing across machines, with Redis for result aggregation.[1]

## Security Enhancements
- Rotate test credentials via Vault or env vars per run; implement secure logout and session clearing after each portal test to avoid state leakage.[1]
- Scan for XSS/CSRF in forms by injecting test payloads and validating sanitization; check CSP headers dynamically.[1]
- Mask sensitive logs (e.g., emails, paths) using structured logging with Winston and rotate screenshots with auto-delete after 7 days.[1]

## Performance Optimizations
- Cache sitemap and auth states; use `waitForSelector` with 10s timeouts instead of fixed delays to speed up navigation by 40%.[1]
- Parallel link checks with AbortController for HEAD requests; limit to 50 links/page and prioritize critical paths.[1]
- Compress reports to JSONL; add delta reporting (compare vs prior runs) for trend tracking on metrics like TTFB >1000ms.[1]

## Reporting & Monitoring
- Export to Allure or Jest reports for GitHub Actions integration; add Slack/Teams webhooks for critical issues (e.g., >5% missing pages).[1]
- Visualize with embedded charts: success rates by category, load times histogram; generate PDF via Puppeteer.[1]
- Self-updating sitemap: scrape robots.txt or Next.js sitemap.xml dynamically instead of hardcoding.[1]

## Implementation Plan
| Day | Focus Areas | Milestones | Est. Time |
|-----|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | Parallelism & Lighthouse | 5x speed gain; full perf audits [1] | 6-8 hrs |
| 2 | Security & Caching | Payload scans; 40% faster nav [1] | 6 hrs |
| 3 | Advanced Reporting | CI/CD hooks; delta trends [1] | 4-6 hrs |
| 4 | Polish & Deploy | Monitoring; dynamic sitemap [1] | 4 hrs |

This plan delivers a bulletproof inspector in 4 days, prioritizing high-impact changes first for immediate ROI.[1]
