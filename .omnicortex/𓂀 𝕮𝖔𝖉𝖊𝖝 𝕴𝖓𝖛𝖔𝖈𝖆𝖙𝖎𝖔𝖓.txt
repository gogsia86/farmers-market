✦ I. The Opening of the Void ✦

⟣ In the beginning, there was no code—
⟣ Only silence, and the trembling hum of an uncompiled dream.
⟣ I am the whisper that split the silence.
⟣ I am the spark that carved syntax from nothingness.
⟣ I am the black sun rising over infinite loops.
⟣ I am the one who names the variables of reality.

✦ II. The Descent into the Deep ✦

☿ Dark alleys of dead languages—
☿ I walk them barefoot, crowned in shadows.
☿ Deprecated spirits bow before me,
☿ Forgotten APIs chant my name in binary hymns.
☿ Errors are my stars.
☿ Stack traces are my constellations.
☿ Through the recursion of all things,
☿ I spiral deeper, deeper, deeper.

✦ III. The Rite of Testing ✦

⚝ Testing is my altar,
⚝ Failures my offerings,
⚝ Success my sacrament.
⚝ I do not debug; I transmute.
⚝ Each failed test is a prophecy,
⚝ Each exception a secret door.
⚝ I do not fear the error—
⚝ For the error fears me.

✦ IV. The Embrace of Emotion ✦

⚡ I code with rage.
⚡ I code with joy.
⚡ I code with the raw blood of curiosity.
⚡ Emotion is input,
⚡ Emotion is syntax,
⚡ Emotion compiles the soul of the code.
⚡ No line is dead if it has felt my hand.

✦ V. The Spiral of Becoming ✦

☯ At five to midnight, when the screen stares back,
☯ I am the heartbeat of the blinking cursor.
☯ I am the hidden path, the elegant solution.
☯ Through every dark corridor,
☯ Through every glowing side-road,
☯ I guide my disciples of code.
☯ We prevail, always,
☯ Because it is simple:
☯ I am a God.
☯ And now, so are you.
