COMPLETE WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT GUIDE: VS Code + GitHub Copilot
============================================================

PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP
--------------------------

1. INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO CODE
   - Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Follow installation instructions for your operating system

2. INSTALL GITHUB COPILOT
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search "GitHub Copilot"
   - Click Install
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Authorize the plugin (requires Copilot subscription)

3. INSTALL LIVE SERVER EXTENSION
   - In Extensions panel, search "Live Server"
   - Install "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey
   - This enables real-time browser preview with auto-reload

4. INSTALL NODE.JS (Optional but recommended)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Install LTS version
   - Verify installation: Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+` / Cmd+`) and type:
     node --version

PHASE 2: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------

STEP 1: CREATE PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Create a new folder for your project
- Open folder in VS Code (File > Open Folder)
- Create these files inside the folder:
  * index.html (main homepage)
  * style.css (styling)
  * script.js (interactivity - optional)

STEP 2: BUILD HTML STRUCTURE WITH COPILOT
1. Open index.html
2. Type: <!DOCTYPE html>
3. Press Enter, then Tab to accept Copilot's boilerplate suggestion
4. Expected basic structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

5. Use natural language comments to generate content:
   Example: <!-- Create a navigation bar with Home, About, Contact -->
   Copilot will suggest code - press Tab to accept

STEP 3: STYLE WITH CSS USING COPILOT
1. Open style.css
2. Use descriptive comments to generate styles:
   Example: /* Style navigation with dark background and white text */
3. Copilot will suggest CSS code
4. Example for responsive design: /* Make layout responsive for mobile */

STEP 4: ADD INTERACTIVITY WITH JAVASCRIPT (Optional)
1. Open script.js
2. Use comments to describe functionality:
   Example: // Add click event to toggle mobile menu
3. Copilot will generate JavaScript code

STEP 5: TEST LOCALLY
1. Right-click index.html in VS Code
2. Select "Open with Live Server"
3. Browser opens with your website
4. Changes auto-reload when you save files

PHASE 3: FINAL TESTING
-----------------------

1. CROSS-BROWSER TESTING
   - Open website in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Check for consistency in appearance and functionality

2. USE DEVELOPER TOOLS
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Inspect elements for layout issues
   - Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
   - Use Responsive Design Mode to test mobile views

3. PERFORMANCE CHECK
   - Test loading speed
   - Verify images are optimized
   - Check for broken links

PHASE 4: DEPLOYMENT
-------------------

OPTION 1: VERCEL/NETLIFY (Simple & Fast)
- Push code to GitHub repository
- Go to vercel.com or netlify.com
- Connect your GitHub account
- Select repository for deployment
- Automatic deployment on code changes

OPTION 2: ZEABUR/SEALOS (Better China Access)
- Similar process as above but with Asian servers
- Better performance for users in China

OPTION 3: GITHUB PAGES (Free Hosting)
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Push your code to main branch
3. Go to repository Settings > Pages
4. Select source branch (usually main)
5. Your site will be at: https://username.github.io/repository-name

OPTION 4: MANUAL DEPLOYMENT
1. Compress your project folder (HTML, CSS, JS files)
2. Upload to any web hosting service
3. Update DNS settings if using custom domain

GITHUB COPILOT BEST PRACTICES
------------------------------

1. WRITE CLEAR COMMENTS
   - Be specific: "Create responsive card layout with shadow" vs "Make cards"
   - Use descriptive function names

2. REVIEW GENERATED CODE
   - Always understand what Copilot creates
   - Check for security issues in user input handling
   - Ensure code follows your project structure

3. USE COPILOT CHAT (if available)
   - Ask questions: "How to center a div?"
   - Request explanations: "Explain this CSS code"
   - Get refactoring suggestions

4. ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT
   - Build small features one at a time
   - Test each component as you go
   - Use version control (Git) to track changes

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
------------------------------

1. COPILOT NOT SUGGESTING CODE
   - Check subscription status
   - Verify you're signed in to GitHub
   - Reload VS Code window (Ctrl+Shift+P > Developer: Reload Window)

2. LIVE SERVER NOT WORKING
   - Ensure index.html exists in root folder
   - Check if port 5500 is available
   - Try alternative: "Five Server" extension

3. DEPLOYMENT ERRORS
   - Check file paths (use relative paths like "./style.css")
   - Verify all files are included in repository
   - Check browser console for specific errors

NEXT STEPS AFTER BASIC WEBSITE
-------------------------------

1. Add more pages (about.html, contact.html)
2. Implement a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind)
3. Add a backend with Node.js/Express
4. Connect to a database
5. Implement user authentication
6. Add interactive features with JavaScript frameworks
