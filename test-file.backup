# This is a test backup file
# Purpose: Trigger the GitHub Action workflow to test backup file detection

This file should be detected by the "Prevent Backup Files" workflow
and cause the CI/CD pipeline to fail with a helpful error message.

Test data:
- File extension: .backup
- Should be caught by pattern: *.backup
- Expected result: PR comment with removal instructions

This is intentional for testing purposes only.
