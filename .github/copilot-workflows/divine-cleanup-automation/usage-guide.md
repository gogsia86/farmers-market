## 📖 EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Activate

```
User: "ACTIVATE DIVINE CLEANUP SYSTEM"
```

### Step 2: Review Report

Copilot generates comprehensive analysis report with:

- All files categorized by confidence level
- Agricultural files protected
- Divine patterns preserved
- Cleanup recommendations

### Step 3: Approve Safe Deletions

```bash
# Copilot provides ready-to-run scripts
git rm .next/cache/**/*
git rm profiling_output/temp_*
git rm *.log
```

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
# Copilot provides verification commands
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git commit -m "chore: divine cleanup - removed build artifacts

🌟 Divine Cleanup System executed
🌾 Agricultural consciousness: PRESERVED
⚡ Files removed: 32 (23.4 MB)
✅ Build time improvement: -12.4s
✅ All tests passing"
```

---

## 🎯 CUSTOMIZATION

### Adjust Confidence Thresholds

Tell Copilot:

```
Use these cleanup thresholds:
- Divine: 90% (more aggressive)
- Quantum: 60% (more aggressive)
- Agricultural: 40% (more aggressive)
```

### Add Custom Patterns

Tell Copilot:

```
Also protect files matching: /legacy-important/
Also protect files matching: /critical-config/
```

### Focus on Specific Areas

```
Analyze only the src/ directory
Analyze only build artifacts
Analyze only unused dependencies
```

---

## 🔧 INTEGRATION WITH WORKFLOW

### Pre-Commit Hook

The system integrates with `.github/scripts/pre-commit.ps1` to:

- Warn about accumulating build artifacts
- Suggest cleanup when repo size grows
- Validate agricultural consciousness on commit

### Scheduled Cleanups

Recommended schedule:

- **Weekly**: Quick cleanup of build artifacts
- **Monthly**: Full divine cleanup analysis
- **Quarterly**: Deep agricultural consciousness audit

---

## 🌟 BEST PRACTICES

### DO ✅

- Run cleanup on a separate git branch
- Review all Quantum and Agricultural tier files manually
- Run full test suite after cleanup
- Commit cleanup as separate, focused commit
- Keep agricultural consciousness at 100%

### DON'T ❌

- Delete Sacred tier files without investigation
- Run cleanup on main/production branch directly
- Skip verification steps
- Ignore agricultural file warnings
- Delete files with divine patterns without review

---

## 📚 ADVANCED USAGE

### Generate Cleanup Report Only

```
QUANTUM FILE ANALYSIS ONLY - no deletion scripts
```

### Focus on Performance

```
Find files slowing down builds
Analyze bundle size contributors
Identify optimization opportunities
```

### Agricultural Domain Integrity

```
AGRICULTURAL CONSCIOUSNESS AUDIT
Verify all farm patterns are intact
Check crop management consistency
Validate harvest workflows
```

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Too many files to analyze"

- Add more exclusion patterns
- Focus on specific directory
- Use seasonal cleanup (smaller scope)

### "Agricultural files at risk"

- Review the flagged files
- Update agricultural patterns
- Manually protect critical files

### "Build fails after cleanup"

- Use rollback command provided
- Check Sacred tier deletions
- Verify dependency graph

---

## 📈 MONITORING

### After Cleanup, Track:

- Build time improvements
- Bundle size reduction
- Test execution speed
- Code quality scores
- Agricultural consciousness level
- Divine pattern compliance

### Success Metrics:

- ✅ Build time reduced by 10-15%
- ✅ Bundle size reduced by 5-10%
- ✅ No test failures
- ✅ Agricultural consciousness = 100%
- ✅ Divine patterns maintained
- ✅ Quantum coherence improved
