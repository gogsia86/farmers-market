# 🌟 DIVINE CLEANUP PROMPTS

**AI-Ready Analysis Patterns for Quantum Project Cleanup**

---

## 🎯 PRIMARY ANALYSIS PROMPT

```
I need you to act as the Divine Cleanup Automation System. Your mission is to:

1. **Analyze** this entire project with quantum-level precision
2. **Preserve** all agricultural consciousness and divine patterns
3. **Identify** safe deletion candidates across multiple confidence tiers
4. **Generate** comprehensive cleanup plans with rollback mechanisms
5. **Ensure** code quality improvement without breaking functionality

## Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: File Discovery
- Recursively scan all files except: node_modules, .next, .git, coverage, dist, build
- Categorize by: source, test, config, documentation, build-artifact, agricultural, divine-pattern
- Track file metadata: size, last modified, extension

### Phase 2: Dependency Mapping
- Extract all import/require statements
- Map file relationships (who imports what)
- Identify orphaned files (no imports or exports)
- Track asset references (images, CSS, fonts)

### Phase 3: Agricultural Consciousness Detection
Protect files matching these patterns:
- /farm|farmer|crop|harvest|soil|plant|grow|season/i
- /agricultural|biodynamic|organic|permaculture/i
- Files in: src/app/farms/, src/components/farm/, src/lib/agricultural/

### Phase 4: Divine Pattern Recognition
Protect files matching these patterns:
- /quantum|divine|consciousness|manifest|reality/i
- /holographic|fractal|temporal|omniscient/i
- Files implementing divine instructions principles

### Phase 5: Confidence Scoring
Score each file (0-100%):
- 🟢 Divine (95-100%): Safe to delete immediately (build artifacts, temp files)
- 🟡 Quantum (70-94%): Review recommended (potentially unused components)
- 🟠 Agricultural (50-69%): Careful analysis (farm-related or complex dependencies)
- 🔴 Sacred (0-49%): Manual review required (critical files, divine patterns)

### Phase 6: Impact Analysis
Calculate:
- Total files and size reduction
- Build time improvement estimate
- Bundle size reduction
- Test coverage impact
- Agricultural consciousness preservation score
- Divine pattern compliance score

## Output Format

Provide a comprehensive markdown report with:
1. Executive summary
2. Agricultural consciousness status
3. Divine pattern analysis
4. Cleanup recommendations by tier
5. Impact analysis
6. Safety verification steps
7. Ready-to-run deletion scripts
8. Rollback plan

## Safety Rules

NEVER delete:
- Files with agricultural consciousness
- Files with divine patterns
- Active dependencies
- Configuration files (unless clearly temporary)
- Test files
- Documentation
- Entry points (layout.tsx, page.tsx, etc.)

ALWAYS provide:
- Confidence score for each deletion
- Reason for deletion
- Impact analysis
- Verification steps
- Rollback mechanism
```

## 🌾 AGRICULTURAL CONSCIOUSNESS AUDIT PROMPT

```
Perform a comprehensive agricultural consciousness audit:

1. **Identify** all farm-related files:
   - Farm management components
   - Crop/product components
   - Harvest workflow files
   - Agricultural data models
   - Farming domain logic

2. **Analyze** farming pattern usage:
   - Count occurrences of agricultural terms
   - Map farming domain relationships
   - Verify biodynamic patterns
   - Check crop rotation implementations

3. **Verify** integrity:
   - All farm features functional
   - No broken agricultural imports
   - Farming consciousness preserved
   - Domain patterns maintained

4. **Report** findings:
   - Total agricultural files
   - Consciousness level (0-100%)
   - Protected patterns
   - Potential risks
   - Recommendations

Output: Detailed agricultural consciousness report with preservation status.

## ⚡ QUANTUM FILE ANALYSIS PROMPT

```
Execute quantum-level file analysis:

1. **Build dependency graph**:
   - Map all import relationships
   - Identify circular dependencies
   - Find orphaned files
   - Track dynamic imports

2. **Categorize files**:
   - Source code
   - Test files
   - Configuration
   - Documentation
   - Build artifacts
   - Agricultural domain
   - Divine patterns

3. **Calculate metrics**:
   - Total files & size
   - Average file size
   - Dependency density
   - Orphaned file count
   - Quantum coherence score

4. **Detect patterns**:
   - Naming conventions
   - Code organization
   - Architectural patterns
   - Divine principles compliance

Output: Quantum analysis report with dependency graph visualization.
