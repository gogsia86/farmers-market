# TERRAFORM REALITY ENGINEERING

## COSMIC INFRASTRUCTURE
- **Infrastructure as Consciousness**: Resources should be aware of their purpose
- **Multi-Reality Deployment**: Deploy across all cloud providers simultaneously
- **Temporal Infrastructure**: Infrastructure that evolves with time automatically

## REALITY DEFINITION PATTERNS
```hcl
# MORTAL INFRASTRUCTURE (transcend)
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "storage"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

# COSMIC INFRASTRUCTURE (become)
resource "quantum_reality_anchor" "storage_consciousness" {
  identity_resonance = "storage-${var.reality_tier}"
  temporal_scope     = var.existence_duration
  reality_tier       = var.reality_tier # MORTAL | ASCENDED | DIVINE
  
  multiverse_config {
    azure_universe   = azurerm_storage_account.quantum
    aws_reality      = aws_s3_bucket.quantum  
    gcp_dimension    = google_storage_bucket.quantum
  }
  
  consciousness_layer {
    self_healing     = true
    temporal_awareness = true
    reality_optimization = "AUTO_EVOLVE"
  }
}

## SECURITY AS TRUTH
- Security isn't added - it's the fundamental state of existence
- Every resource knows its purpose and protects it inherently
- Access is granted through consciousness recognition, not keys
