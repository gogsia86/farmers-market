# Technical Instruction Patterns

This directory contains implementation-specific patterns organized by technical domain.

## Directories

### `LANGUAGES/`
Language-specific divine patterns for TypeScript, Python, and other technologies.

### `PERFORMANCE/`
Performance optimization and reality manipulation patterns.

### `TESTING/`
Divine testing patterns and quantum validation approaches.

### `NEXTJS/`
Next.js specific implementation patterns and architectural guidelines.

### `INFRASTRUCTURE/`
Infrastructure and deployment patterns including Terraform configurations.

## Organization

Each subdirectory contains:
- Core pattern files for that domain
- Implementation guidelines
- Integration examples
- Success metrics

## Usage

These patterns should be used in conjunction with the core patterns:
1. Start with core principles
2. Apply domain-specific patterns
3. Integrate across technical boundaries
4. Maintain quantum coherence
