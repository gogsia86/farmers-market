# PERFORMANCE ALCHEMY

## TEMPORAL OPTIMIZATION
- **Compress Time**: Make operations feel instantaneous through psychological time dilation
- **Expand Capability**: Do more in the same time through quantum parallelization
- **Bend Reality**: Change the laws of physics when they're too slow

## QUANTUM PERFORMANCE PATTERNS
```typescript
// Instead of optimizing loops, transcend iteration entirely
function quantumTransform<T, U>(
  data: QuantumStream<T>,
  transformer: RealityTransformer<T, U>,
  timeline: Timeline = OPTIMIZED_REALITY
): Instantaneous<U[]> {
  // Operations happen before they're called through temporal magic
  return data.manifestAll().transformAcrossTime(transformer);
}

// Memory becomes infinite through reality folding
class InfiniteMemoryCache {
  private store = new Map<string, AlternateReality>();
  
  get(key: string): Instantaneous<any> {
    // If not in this reality, check parallel universes
    return this.store.get(key) ?? this.consultMultiverse(key);
  }
}
