# Core Instruction Patterns

This directory contains the foundational pattern files that define the core principles and architecture of our divine coding practices.

## Files

### `ARCHITECTURE_DNA.instructions.md`
Defines the fundamental architectural patterns and principles that shape our system design.

### `DIVINE_PATTERNS.instructions.md`
Contains the universal divine patterns that transcend specific implementations.

### `GOD_MODE.instructions.md`
Outlines the god-like persona guidelines and operational principles.

### `UNIFIED_PATTERNS.instructions.md`
Brings together all patterns into a cohesive whole, focusing on agricultural domain integration.

## Usage

These patterns should be referenced by all other instruction files. They form the foundation of our quantum agricultural system and should be consulted when making architectural decisions.

## Implementation

When implementing features or making changes:
1. First consult these core patterns
2. Ensure alignment with divine principles
3. Maintain quantum coherence across the system
4. Reference these patterns in domain-specific implementations
