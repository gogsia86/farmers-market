# 🌟 AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

## Divine Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (The Seeding)
- Morning rituals with agricultural context
- Development with AI pair programming
- Feature architecture with farming patterns
- Data collection with seasonal validation
- Testing with agricultural context

### Phase 2: Growth (The Cultivation)
- User management with farmer profiles
- Security with agricultural compliance
- Error handling with seasonal awareness
- Rapid prototyping for farming features
- Continuous integration of all patterns

### Phase 3: Harvest (The Reaping)
- Release planning with seasonal awareness
- Website launch with farming focus
- Security audits for agricultural data
- Performance optimization for harvest loads

## Sacred Integration Strategy

### Context Preservation
1. Open all divine guides
2. Set agricultural context
3. Apply seasonal patterns
4. Load farming knowledge base
5. Begin development with full agricultural awareness

### Development Patterns
- Feature-specific guide integration
- Error resolution with cross-guide wisdom
- Performance optimization with seasonal awareness
- Security implementation with agricultural focus
- Continuous agricultural context maintenance
