## 🚀 EXAMPLE USAGE

```markdown
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Farmers Market platform shows strong architectural foundations with
Next.js 14 and proper domain modeling. However, critical performance
bottlenecks in farm search (3.2s average) and missing security headers
pose immediate risks. Opportunities exist in caching strategy and
agricultural workflow automation.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS 🔴

1. **Database N+1 Queries in Farm Listings** (Effort: M)

   - Current: 1 query + N queries per farm for products
   - Impact: 3.2s page load on 50 farms
   - Fix: Implement Prisma `include` for single query
   - Reference: [Performance Bending - Multi-Dimensional Loading](./instructions/03_PERFORMANCE_REALITY_BENDING.instructions.md#multi-dimensional-data-loading)

2. **Missing Security Headers** (Effort: S)
   - No CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options
   - Risk: XSS and clickjacking vulnerabilities
   - Fix: Add security middleware in next.config.js
   - Reference: [Testing Security - Security Divinity](./instructions/05_TESTING_SECURITY_DIVINITY.instructions.md#security-divinity)
