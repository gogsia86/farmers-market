## 🎯 How to Use This System

### **Daily Workflow**

#### **Morning (Session Start)**

1. Open `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` to see where you left off
2. Review `ACTIVE_SPRINT.md` for current goals
3. Use Copilot to plan your day:

```bash
@workspace /.copilot/SESSION_CONTEXT.md /.copilot/ACTIVE_SPRINT.md
Good morning! Review my session notes and active sprint. What should I focus on today?
```

#### **During Development**

Reference divine instructions using templates from `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`:

```bash
@workspace /.copilot/ACTIVE_SPRINT.md /.github/instructions/[relevant].md
[Your specific request]
```

#### **Evening (Session End)**

Update `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` with:

- What you completed today
- New learnings and insights
- Where you left off
- What to start tomorrow

### **Weekly Workflow**

#### **Sprint Planning**

Update `ACTIVE_SPRINT.md` with:

- New sprint goals

## 🌟 Key Principles

### **Three-Tier Architecture**

1. **Divine Instructions** (`.github/instructions/`)
   - Primary source of truth
   - HOW to code with divine patterns
   - Permanent, comprehensive reference

2. **Planning Docs** (`docs/planning/`)
   - Business requirements
   - WHAT to build
   - Product specifications

3. **Daily Context** (`.copilot/` - THIS DIRECTORY)
   - SESSION state tracking
   - Quick reference shortcuts
   - Personal development notes

### **Lightweight by Design**

This directory is intentionally MINIMAL:

- ✅ Quick daily updates (not full documentation)
- ✅ Links to divine instructions (not duplication)
- ✅ Session state tracking (not permanent records)
- ✅ Personal notes (not team documentation)

### **Agricultural Consciousness**

Everything in this directory embodies farming awareness:

- Seasonal patterns in sprint planning
- Biodynamic naming in examples
- Quantum consciousness in templates
- Hardware optimization awareness

## 🚀 Maintenance Guidelines

### **What to Update Regularly**

- ✅ `ACTIVE_SPRINT.md` - Sprint goals, completed items
- ✅ `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Daily notes, learnings, next steps

### **What Stays Mostly Static**

- ℹ️ `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Update only when divine instructions change
- ℹ️ `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Reference only, no updates needed
- ℹ️ `README.md` (this file) - Update if workflow changes

### **What NOT to Do**

- ❌ Don't duplicate divine instructions here
- ❌ Don't create full documentation (use `docs/`)
- ❌ Don't track team-wide state (personal notes only)
- ❌ Don't let files become stale (update daily)

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### **Keep It Current**

- Update `SESSION_CONTEXT.md` at end of each session
- Review `ACTIVE_SPRINT.md` weekly
- Don't let notes become outdated

### **Link, Don't Duplicate**

- Reference divine instructions by path
- Link to planning docs
- Keep this directory lightweight

### **Make It Personal**

- Customize templates to your style
- Add your own quick commands
- Track what matters to YOU

### **Stay Agricultural**

- Use farming metaphors in notes
- Apply seasonal thinking to sprints
- Embody biodynamic consciousness
