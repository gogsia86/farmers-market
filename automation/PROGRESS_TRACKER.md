## Automation Instructions

### File Structure

This file uses HTML comments as markers to enable automated updates:

- `<!-- SECTION_START -->` and `<!-- SECTION_END -->` wrap updatable sections
- Each section can be independently updated by automation tools

### Updating Progress

1. Active Task:
   - Update between `<!-- ACTIVE_TASK_START -->` and `<!-- ACTIVE_TASK_END -->`
   - Include task name, start time, and current status

2. Metrics:
   - Update between `<!-- METRICS_START -->` and `<!-- METRICS_END -->`
   - Automatically calculated from task statuses

3. Task Status:
   - Each task section has its own markers
   - Update status, progress, and last activity fields

4. Activity Log:
   - Add new entries between `<!-- ACTIVITY_LOG_START -->` and `<!-- ACTIVITY_LOG_END -->`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - Activity description`

### Automation Hooks

- File uses consistent section markers for automated parsing
- Each task has a unique identifier for tracking
- Status changes trigger metrics recalculation
- Activity log automatically updates with all changes

## Integration Points

1. Git Hooks:
   - Pre-commit hook to validate format
   - Post-commit hook to update activity log

2. CI/CD:
   - Automated metrics calculation
   - Progress report generation
   - Status dashboard updates

3. Development Workflow:
   - IDE integration for quick updates
   - Automated PR descriptions
   - Status checks integration
